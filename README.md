Scripts called 2_Name through 5_Name were used to manipulate data and obtain the predictor values for each remote sensing raster.

The ACTUAL_RESULTS folder has the tables containing all calculated predictor values from all remote sensing data, from which the results were calculated.

Scripts called Fig_Name were used to create the corresponding Figures in each chapter.

The f_name scripts are helper functions that I used in multiple scripts. They are invoked with `source()` at the beginning of each script that uses them, after the packages are called.
